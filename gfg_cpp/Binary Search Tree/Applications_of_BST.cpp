/*
Applications of BST/ Self BST :-
    In this, we discusses the various applications of a binary search tree.

    1) To maintain sorted "stream of data" (or sorted "set of data"..) 
    2) To implement doubly ended Priority queue.. 
        we known that single ended priority queue can be implemented using heap.. like min, max of heap..
    3) To slove Problems like :-                    O(Log n) :- Insert, delete..
        a) Count smaller/greater in a stream,
        b) Floor/ceiling/greater/smaller in a stream.
    ** In case of search/insert/delete we can use hash table but in case of sorted order, or internal deletion, insertion we need to use self BST.
